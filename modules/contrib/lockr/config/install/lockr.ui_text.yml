      Welcome to Lockr! You're just a few steps away from storing your
      keys safe and secure. To make things simple we've laid out a few
      key elements (pun intended) that the system requires in order to
      run. Fill out the forms below and once all rows on the table are
      green, you're good to go! It's that simple! If you'd like
      assistance in getting up and running be sure to
      <a href="mailto:support@lockr.io">email us</a> or connect with us
      on <a href="http://slack.lockr.io">Slack</a>.

      All systems are a go! Your site is registered, your certificate
      is valid and everything seems good on our end. The table below
      will give you the status of all elements. Should anything look
      out of the ordinary just let us know on the Slack channel and
      we'd be happy to help. Happy Keying!
  status:
    cert:
      valid: >
        You're a certified Lockr user! We've found your certificate and
        it validates with our system.
      not_valid: >
        Oops! Looks like we need to know who you are before we give you
        the keys to the castle. Your certificate is not valid, please
        register for one. If you've already gotten a certificate, we are
        unable to find it. Please check the advanced settings to ensure
        your path is correct (or if you're on a hosting partner contact
        their support).
    path:
      exists: >
        We've found your private directory and are stashing the
        certificates there for now. We HIGHLY recommend moving the
        certificates to a directory OUTSIDE the webroot that is not
        publicly available.
      invalid: >
        We cannot find your private directory to temporarily store the
        certificates that are generated. Please ensure you have a private
        directory and reload the page.

      You have not connected this site to a KeyRing on Lockr,
      please follow the steps below to complete setup.
      If you've already created a certificate, we are unable to find it.
      Please check the advanced settings to ensure your path is correct

        We've got your credit card safely on file and you'll be recieving
        regular invoices for your key usage.
      missing:
        required: >
          Uh oh! Without a credit card we cannot issue a production
          certificate. Please add one before migrating to production.
        partner: >
          Since you're on a partnering host, a credit card is not necessary
          to move to production. However, please make sure you get a card on
          file ASAP. We will contact you if there is no card on file within
          30 days of moving to production use.
